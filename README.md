# Indian Premier League (IPL) Prediction and Statistical Insights

## üèè Project Overview
This project aims to predict the outcomes of Indian Premier League (IPL) matches using various machine learning models. By analyzing historical match data from 2008 to 2022, we derive statistical insights and build predictive models to forecast match results.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

### üìÇ data/
Contains datasets used for analysis and modeling.
- `IPL_Matches_2008_2022.csv` - Comprehensive match data from 2008 to 2022.
- `IPL_Ball_by_Ball_2008_2022.csv` - Ball-by-ball details of each match.
- `IPLPlayerAuctionData.csv` - Information on player auctions and team compositions.

### üìÇ notebooks/
Jupyter notebooks detailing data analysis and model development.
- `MATH448_Project_IPL_Prediction.ipynb` - Notebook covering data preprocessing, EDA, and model implementation.

### üìÇ reports/
Documentation and reports generated from the analysis.
- `MATH 448 - IPL Prediction - Final Report.pdf` - Summarizes methodologies, findings, and conclusions.

### üìÇ visualizations/
Visual representations of data insights and model results.
- `IPL_Prediction_EDA.pbix` - Power BI file showcasing interactive dashboards and visualizations.

## üîç Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Team Performance**: Win/loss ratios, home vs. away performance.
- **Player Statistics**: Top performers, consistency metrics.
- **Venue Analysis**: Impact of venues on match outcomes.
- **Toss Influence**: Effect of toss decisions on match results.

## üß† Modeling Approach

Applied six machine learning algorithms to predict match outcomes:
1. **Logistic Regression** - Baseline classification model.
2. **Decision Tree Classifier** - Captures non-linear relationships.
3. **Random Forest Classifier** - Ensemble method to improve accuracy.
4. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** - Effective in high-dimensional spaces.
5. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** - Simple, instance-based learning.
6. **Na√Øve Bayes** - Based on Bayes' theorem with independence assumptions.

### Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy**: Proportion of correct predictions.
- **Precision**: True positive rate among predicted positives.
- **Recall**: True positive rate among actual positives.
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
